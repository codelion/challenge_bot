# ChallengeBot

## Commands
There's a tiny bit of flexibility for most commands. This is to make them easier to remember. Verbs like `send` are usually interchangable with `tell` and `give`. Some responses, particularly requesting your submission code, are in the form of direct messages. To recieve direct messages from a Twitter user, you *must follow that user*. If you're not getting responses, make sure you're following the bot.

Commands:

* send me my submission code - sends randomly-generated submission code, must be following the bot to get this message!
* submit {challenge name} {answer} - accepts submission, confirms if answer is correct if challenge is over
* send me {challenge name} info - sends you the start and end dates for a challenge
* check {challenge name} - tells you your previously submitted answer, and if it's correct
* a few more ;), check the source
